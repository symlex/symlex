# Should I use Symlex?

Give it a try if you already like Symfony and would like to work in a leaner, more agile way.

## Pros ##

- By far the fastest PHP framework according to [phpbenchmarks.com](http://www.phpbenchmarks.com/en/)
- Code and memory footprint is very small
- Built on top of well documented and tested standard components
- Designed to be simple with few concepts to understand
- Easier to learn than many other frameworks
- Using Symlex results in more maintainable and testable code that is fundamental for agile development
- It has proven to be well suited for rapidly building microservices, CLI and single-page applications
- It comes complete with working examples which are the best form of documentation
- Contains everything to create full-featured Web applications: Service container, REST routing & Twig template engine
- Plain classes are used wherever possible to avoid vendor lock-in and enable framework independent code reuse (other 
  frameworks often try to lock you in with proprietary annotations and specific base classes you have to inherit from)
- You can use it with Symfony Components and any other PHP library out there
- Even if you choose not to use Symlex, you might find lots of inspiration for your own projects (for example, you
  can build your own framework around the [micro-kernel](https://github.com/symlex/di-microkernel) or learn 
  how to integrate JavaScript with PHP)
- Easy to upgrade to new versions of Symfony
- You are free to create a fork if you want to be in full control and don't trust the community for any reason

## Cons ##

- While you can get [commercial support](https://blog.liquidbytes.net/contact/), Symlex is not backed by a major company and has a small community:
  Development started to have a high-performance replacement for FOSRestBundle, it was never our goal to build a business
- It is not good for developers who are not comfortable reading at least small amounts of framework code as not 
  everything is documented 100% (you're welcome to ask for help via email or send additional docs as pull request)
- There is no support for Symfony Bundles in Symlex 
  - Using them often adds complexity to the overall architecture: They hide bootstrap / configuration details 
    and encourage to build bloated applications 
  - Symlex is designed to build focused, lean and fully testable applications
  - Writing meaningful unit tests is not possible, if certain functionality is exclusively encoded in framework 
    configuration files or magically generated by bundles
  - Acceptance tests could be created, but they are slow and not well suited for test driven development (TDD) and refactoring
- Annotations are also not supported as we find them difficult to maintain and test
  - We prefer a tiny bit of code instead or use the service container to configure our apps
- Copy and pasting code from Stack Overflow or the Symfony documentation sometimes won't work without 
  understanding it and adapting it a little e.g. when it comes to service configuration or routing
